# Extensionless pages when developing a Middleman site

Middleman offers one way to get pretty URLs – URLs without the `.html` suffix – through [Directory Indexes](http://middlemanapp.com/pretty-urls/). This is done by replacing the file with a directory, and making the file the index.html document of that directory.

In most cases, Directory Indexes is the simplest and most Middleman-ish way to go. 

But sometimes an alternative solution is needed. For me, the problem was that I was migrating an existing site, that already had been indexed by Google, and I did not want the URLs of the pages to change. 

## Using the web server to get rid of the extension
An alternative way, is to let the web server handle this. 

**Apache**

Add this to the `.htaccess` file

`Options +MultiViews` ([Documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/content-negotiation.html#negotiation for some documentation)).
 
Other ways to achieve the same thing are to set it in the `httpd.conf` or to use redirects in the `.htaccess` file.

**Nginx**

Add these two lines within your server block

```nginx
location / { try_files $uri.html $uri/index.html /fallback.html; }
location = /fallback.html { }
```

On an Rack based server (like Sinatra or Ruby on Rails) I think that [TryStatic]( https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/try_static.rb), on which OptionalHtml is based, is a good way to do this.

As long as internal links in your source documents links to URL **with** the `.html` extension, you can now develop the site as usual. The only thing you need to watch out for, is that a URL like `http://www.domain.com/something`, may (depending on server configuration) point to `http://www.domain.com/something.html`, not `http://www.domain.com/something/index.html`, so avoid mixing files and directories with the same name. 

## Getting rid of extensions on the Middleman development server
In my case, with the migrated site, the internal links did not have the `.html` extension. So I created `optional_html`, to make the development server (`middleman server`) behave the same way as the web server for the built site. 

`optional_html` is based on [TryStatic]( https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/try_static.rb), but adapted to work when using Middlemans development server. 

If there is no match for the requested url, it will try the same url with some different versions of a .html suffix.

## Installation

To use, add

`gem "optional_html", :git => 'https://github.com/tommysundstrom/middleman-rack-optional-html.git'`

to your Gemfile and run `build install`

In `config.rb` add

```
require "rack/middleman/optional_html"
use Rack::OptionalHtml,
   :root => "/path/to/your/source/directory/",
   :urls => %w[/]
```

Please note that this is an early version. It seams to work as intended, but is not thoroughly tested yet.
